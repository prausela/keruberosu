# Keruberosu

PWA written in React to help JLPT N5 students study. Project structure was based off an N-tier schema. Having maintainability in mind, adding questions and new modes is relatively easy.

Keruberosu is comprised of three components:
- [Jouzu Atama](https://github.com/prausela/jouzu-atama) (REST API)
- [Jouzu Kizuna](https://github.com/prausela/jouzu-kizuna) (User app)
- [Jouzu Conpanion](https://github.com/prausela/jouzu-conpanion) (Backoffice/Teacher app)
